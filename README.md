# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Task: Creating a day scheduler that dynamically changes and adjusts to user inputs.
* Goal: To create a dynamic webpage that allows a user to organize their daily schedule. It must be able to assist the user in logging their hourly activity while keeping track of the current hour. The information that is stored in the hourly planner areas must remain when the page is reloaded or closed and reopened. 
* Specifications: The webpage must use moment.js to log the current day automatically. The current hour will then be used to show the user what the current hour is by changing the text box colors accordingly. When an hourly task is logged into the text box, and the users clicks the save icon, the value in the box must be saved locally. When the page is reloaded this information must then be pulled and placed in the positions where the user left them.
* Points of Emphasis: This project will specifically exhibit newly attained skills in javascript and HTML such as the use of bootstrap and Jquery to assist in page layout and class organization. The ability to utilize third party information that dynamically changes the state of the webpage is imperative, along with displaying knowledge of local storage and how to use it.
* Completion: This project is completed when fully functioning HTML, CSS, javascript and READ.ME files are pushed and submitted into a github repository. Then the Link is shown here: https://mitchellm27.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![Below is the layout of how the site should appear when opened. Upon completion, the past hours will be grey, the present will be red, and the future will be green. Each hour's text box will allow the user to save its contents with the save button to the right.](Assets/05-third-party-apis-homework-demo.gif)
